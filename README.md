### Install

You can install from the .flatpak file from latest release on any distribution:

On Windows, run `NekoPlay-Setup.exe`, or unpack the portable `NekoPlay`
folder anywhere and run `nekoplay.exe` — either way nothing else is needed.

### Build from source

Clone the repo in GNOME Builder and press run.

For Windows, build in an MSYS2 UCRT64 shell:

```bash
./build-aux/windows/build.sh
./build-aux/windows/bundle.sh --with-anime4k
./build-aux/windows/installer.sh
```

See [build-aux/windows/README.md](build-aux/windows/README.md) for the
dependency list and notes on how the port works.
